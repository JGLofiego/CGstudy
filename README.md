# Computer Graphics with Three.js
## 🎨 Interactive 3D graphics projects built with Three.js.

This repository showcases my work from a computer graphics course, focusing on:

- 3D Modeling & Rendering (Meshes, textures, lighting)

- Animation & Interaction (Keyframe animations, user controls)

- Shaders & Effects (GLSL, post-processing, particle systems)

- Web-Based Visualization (Real-time rendering in the browser)

## Projects
✅ **Completed Projects**:

- First-Person Museum (Collision detection, lighting, Rendering, Mapping)

- Ray Tracing Basics (GLSL shaders, reflections)

- Post-Processing filters (GLSL shaders)

🛠️ **Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Three.js, WebGL, GLSL

📌 Academic project – free to explore!
